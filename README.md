For starting just configure service by editing setting.py file and run start.bat (for Windows)


All service's settings contained in setting.py file:



app_username = '792727000000'			        	 		# Page login

app_password = 'password'						          	# Page password

app_secret_key = b'mybestsecretkeyintheworld'		# Secret key (any ASCII-like value)

app_limit = 20								               		# Audio limiting

app_host = "127.0.0.1"						          		# IP for service

app_port = 8890									              	# Port for service
